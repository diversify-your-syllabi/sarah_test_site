This website is dedicated to increasing the visibility and representation of women and 
underrepresented groups in statistics and statistics literature. Previous work in other fields,
such as [**international relations**](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-organization/article/gender-citation-gap-in-international-relations/3A769C5CFA7E24C32641CDB2FD03126A), has shown that studies with a female first- or only-author recieve around 80% as many
citations as similar studies authored by men. The problem begins early: with our syllabi.
We aim to provide a repository of female-authored statistics articles that can be used
to "Diversify Your Syllabi." Thanks for dropping by.
