  This website is the brainchild of Dr. Jenine Harris, Professor of Biostatistics at Washington Univeristy, St. Louis. After noticing the lack of representation of women and underrepresented groups in statistics - both in terms of citations and presence - she set out to create a forum dedicated to increasing the representativeness of these groups in statistics and statistics literature. Previous work in other fields,
such as [**international relations**](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-organization/article/gender-citation-gap-in-international-relations/3A769C5CFA7E24C32641CDB2FD03126A) and [**political science**](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0be4/54d2567bbf87461116323fe2b979f46f344f.pdf), has shown that studies with a female first- or only-author recieve fewer citations than similar studies authored by men. The problem begins early: with our syllabi. By creating a repository of high-quality, woman-authored statistics research readily available, we aim to help "Diversify Your Syllabi." Thanks for dropping by.
